  m_eventText: "By developing collective farming we succeeded in drawing this entire
    mass of poor peasants into collective farms, In giving them security and raising
    them to the level of middle peasants \u2026 What does this mean? It means that
    no less than 20,000,000 of the peasant population have been saved from poverty
    and ruin, from kulak slavery, and converted, thanks to the collective farms,
    into people assured of a livelihood. This is a great achievement comrades. This
    is such an achievement as the world has never yet known and such as not a single
    state in the world has ever before secured."
